A replication of findings from [Finlayson et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06087) for checking subject-verb agreement!

To run, simply run all cells in `code.ipynb`. The notebook will generate bar plots and a line plot towards the end to compare affects per layer, and per neuron. You can also increase num_neurons for more accuracy (I left it at 500 since a larger number would take way too long).
